An alternative would be to use the useEffect unmount callback to send an event which App could consume that would cache the data when the component unmounted and provide as props when the component mounted again. But then your child component is coupled to your parent component (or App if that's the parent). You could do all of this with events rather than using props at all, but you might find such extreme decoupling demands more boilerplate than you want to write. With purity comes a price.

Obviously you could do an api call from a component when it mounts with useEffect, but you could also get data on the app level before the component mounts, because maybe you want your data to be uncoupled from your component lifecycle. Just set it up so app initialization requests data from an api and when a component mounts, it sends an event requesting the data, and if we already have that data locally the data is returned in a subsequent event. If not, we can request the data and return it in a subsequent event and the component does not know or care whether that data was cached locally, mocked, or return from an API request.

If you have developed large-scale\n        react apps, you will recognize this is highly desirable for performance reasons.\n      </p>\n      <div className={'ExampleSection'}>\n        <h5>Example Application</h5>\n        <p>\n          Here we have three components, UIControls, Component1 and Component2. UIControls sends an event\n          to request the data. Component1 and Component2 are awaiting the result, each observing ReactiveRobot\n          and waiting for its own custom event. When you click GET DATA, UIControls sends a GET_DATA event, which App\n          receives, and then App calls the getData function on DataService, which in this case sets an interval and\n          starts generating mock data which will randomly send update events to all of the observers.\n          Logging has been added to allow you to see in the console what is rerendering on what events.\n        </p>\n        <UIControls/>\n        <div className={'ComponentsContainer'}>\n          <Component1/>\n          <Component2/>\n        </div>\n\n      </div>\n\n      <h5>Digging Deeper</h5>\n      <p>\n        Obviously, this is not a full-scale application. And there are some issues that will come up that aren't addressed\n        in this example. If you don't have global state and you've pushed it all the way down the component tree to your leaf\n        components, how do you maintain their state when they mount, unmount and remount again?\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        There are a couple of simple ways to do this. First, maintain data that you might need again in a globaldata\n        object (which is not state, and should never cause a rerender). I would put that object in App. App can listen\n        for the event required to cache the data. In that case, you are duplicating your observation for the event\n        in App and in the consuming Component. This is more boilerplate than I would like, but it is solid, and\n        allows a great deal of flexibility if lots of different components that mount and unmount are sharing data.\n        An alternative would be to use the useEffect unmount callback to send an event which App could consume that\n        would cache the data when the component unmounted and provide as props when the component mounted again.\n        But then your child component is coupled to your parent component (or App if that's the parent).\n        You could do all of this with events rather than using props at all, but you might find such extreme\n        decoupling demands more boilerplate than you want to write. With purity comes a price. With ReactiveRobot,\n        you decide where you want to be on that spectrum of decoupling. You may find that it is useful to use props\n        in some cases and events in others.\n\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Just remember, ReactiveRobot is short on rules and long on flexibility. You decide where you want to store\n        data and initiate things like api calls. Obviously you could do an api call from a component when it mounts with\n        useEffect, but you could also get data on the app level before the component mounts, because maybe you want\n        your data to be uncoupled from your component lifecycle. Just set it up so app initialization requests data\n        from an api and when a component mounts, it sends an event requesting the data, and if we already have that data\n        locally the data is returned in a subsequent event. If not, we can request the data and return it in a subsequent\n        event and the component does not know or care whether that data was cached locally, mocked, or return from an API\n        request. This gives you huge flexibility for mocking, testing and scaling.\n      </p>\n      <h5>Why Not Props</h5>\n      <p>\n        Shouldn't I be using dumb components that just get props? Well, yes, if they really are dumb, that is, only\n        displaying static data. Then you might as well pass props, display those, and you're done. But often, we\n        want a component to load data, and also allow a user to change it, as in a pre-filled form that the user\n        could update. If those properties are in props, and they need to be updated, then you are forced to\n        update the parent to update the child, and potentially will cause unnecessary renders of siblings. For anything\n        that could change, you generally want those to come in events, not props.\n      </p>\n      <h5>Comparisons with Redux</h5>\n      <p>\n        Like Redux, ReactiveRobot has a specific way to update things. Send an event. Unlike Redux, there is no\n        enforcement of this in the code, it is up to you to understand it and use it correctly. Also, unlike Redux,\n        there is no embrace of immutability here. Use immutable objects if you like, ReactiveRobot don't care.\n        I'd say the main purpose of code is to mutate data - so don't be afraid to. And unlike Redux where everybody\n        gets access to a global Store, there is no such concept baked into ReactiveRobot. Ideally, components should\n        not know or care where their data comes from.\n      </p>\n      <h5>But Let's Say I'm Really Lazy</h5>\n      <p>\n        This seems like a lot of boilerplate just to not have global state. Isn't there an easier way? Sure. Pass your globalData\n        object to everyone, but still use ReactiveRobot to let things know when an update is of concern to them. In this case,\n        all of your components are coupled to your globalData object, but you still have the benefit that components are\n        simply reacting to events, rather than updates on the globalData object itself. But be aware that because everyone has\n        access to globalData, you have lost the control and decoupling that you get from knowing that only events can update\n        the data. The choice is yours. ReactiveRobot is a tool to give you a range of options, from a lightly coupled,\n        event based reactive system, where everyone can see a global object, to a highly decoupled event based reactive system,\n        where you are enforcing that no object or component ever knows where its data is coming from, or is able to update that\n        data directly.\n      </p>\n      <h5>Observations On Observing and Listening</h5>\n      <p>\n        Why are we using observers here instead of listeners? Because the visual metaphor is trendy right now. But seriously,\n        the audio metaphor is the same. You can be observing events or listening, same thing. Most of your basic intros\n        to rx based reactive systems will start teaching you about observables with the metaphor of listening to mouse activity\n        and thinking about it as a stream of data using listeners, aka observables. Because there is a similarity between\n        ReactiveRobot and rxjs, I've used \"next\" as the method name to indicate there is another event in the stream.\n        I could have used \"trigger\" but that seemed so...jQuery. We want to stay current, but recognize these issues have\n        a long history of multiple solutions. I am just trying to add another solution that has worked well for me, scales\n        easily, and encourages optimal performance with react.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
