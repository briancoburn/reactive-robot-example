Maybe call the API the first time, then just reload\n        cached data from rr.gData. Maybe you get all the data when the app loads, and just respond to events as needed,\n        or maybe you mock everything because the API isn't available yet or you're testing. With Reactive Robot,\n        it's up to you.\n      </p>\n      <h5>Comparisons with Redux</h5>\n      <p>\n        Like Redux, ReactiveRobot has a specific way to rerender in response to changes in state. Send an event. Unlike Redux,\n        there is no enforcement of how you make updates. You can decouple everything with a model that only responds to events,\n        or stick everything on gData, or anything in between. Also, unlike Redux, there is no embrace of immutability here.\n        Use immutable objects if you like. And unlike Redux where everybody gets access to a global Store, this is not a\n        requirement in Reactive Robot. If you have global data that needs to be cached and arbitrarily available, you have\n        the gData object as a convenience.\n      </p>\n      <h5>Observations On Observing and Listening</h5>\n      <p>\n        Why are we using observers here instead of listeners? Because the visual metaphor is trendy right now. But seriously,\n        the audio metaphor is the same. You can be observing events or listening, same thing. Most of your basic intros\n        to rx based reactive systems will start teaching you about observables with the metaphor of listening to mouse activity\n        and thinking about it as a stream of data using listeners, aka observables. Because there is a similarity between\n        ReactiveRobot and rxjs, I've used \"next\" as the method name to indicate there is another event in the stream.\n        I could have used \"trigger\" but that seemed so...jQuery. We want to stay current, but recognize these issues have\n        a long history of multiple solutions. I am just trying to add another solution that has worked well for me, scales\n        easily, and encourages optimal performance with react.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
